Explain how python manages memory automatically.
why does the programming not need to explicitly allocate and free memory ?

Python manages memory automatically through a built-in memory manager that handles 
the allocation and deallocation of memory for objects.
This is primarily achieved through a combination of reference counting and a garbage collector.  


Because of this automatic memory management, programmers do not need to explicitly allocate and free memory. 
This reduces the likelihood of memory leaks and other memory-related issues,
