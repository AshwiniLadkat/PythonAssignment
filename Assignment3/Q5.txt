#what is differece between 
  print()
  return
#Explain with examples

print()

Purpose: To show information (text, variables) on the screen for a human user, often for debugging or displaying results.
Action: Outputs to the console/terminal.
Function Impact: Doesn't affect the function's value; if a function only prints and doesn't return anything else, it implicitly returns None.
def Display(name):
  print(f"Hello, {name}!") # Prints to console

# Calling Display()
Display("Ashwini") # Output: Hello, Ashwini!

# What happens if you try to use its "result"?
result = Display("Ladkat") 
print(result)  
# Output: Hello, Ladkat!



return
Purpose: To send a value from a function so it can be used else where in the program
Action: Exits the function and passes data back to the calling statement.
Function Impact: Provides the function's output/result. 

def add_numbers(a, b):
  return a + b # Returns the sum

# Calling add_numbers() and storing the returned value
sum_result = add_numbers(5, 3) # sum_result now holds 8

# Now we can use the returned value (e.g., print it)
print(sum_result) # Output: 8

# Or use it in another calculation
another_result = add_numbers(sum_result, 10)
print(another_result) # Output: 18
