What is difference between List and Tuple in Python? Explain in terms of 
    Mutability , Memory , Perfomance and Use cases 
 List vs Tuple in Python   
 1. Mutability:
     Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, added, 
     or removed after the list is created.
     Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their elements 
     cannot be changed, added, or removed.
 2. Memory:
     Tuples generally use less memory than lists because they are immutable

 3. Performance:
     Tuples can be slightly faster than lists for certain operations due to their immutability
    e.g iterating through a tuple is faster than iterating through a list.
 4. Use Cases:
     Lists are used when you need a collection of items that may change
     Tuples are used when you need a collection of items that should not change
