#Predict the output
s = "Python" 
print(id(s)) 
s= s + "3" 
print(id(s)) 
Exaplin the reason for change/no change in id 
  
# Explanation:
    #Line2 : This will create a string object in memory
    #Line3 : # print mememory address of string object S
    #Line4 : # This will create a new strig object in memory after concatenation 
    #Line5 : # This is print memory address of new string object after concatenation
    
    #Explanation: Since string is immutable in Python, when we modify the string by concatenating "3" to it,
    #a new string object is created in memory. Therefore, the id of the string changes after the modification.
