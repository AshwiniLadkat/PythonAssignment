 What is Range datatype in Python? How it is different from list of numbers?
 Range datatype in Python represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping 

 Difference between Range and List of numbers:
 1. Memory Efficiency:  Range  do not store all the numbers in memory at once.
                         Lists, on the other hand, store all the elements in memory. hence range is more memory efficient 
                          for large sequences.
 2. Immutability: Range objects are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation.
                  Lists are mutable, allowing modification of their elements.
 3. Performance:  Range objects can be faster for iteration in loops since they do not require 
                  the overhead of to storage numbers in memory.
 4. Functionality:  Lists provide more functionality and methods for manipulation 
                   (like append, remove, etc.) compared to range objects,
                    Range objects which are primarily used for iteration.
