Why are the tuples Faster than the lists? In which real world scenario would you prefer the tuples
over the lists? Explain with example code.
Tuples are generally faster than lists in Python due to their immutability.
Since tuples cannot be modified after their creation, Python can optimize their storage and access patterns more efficiently than lists,
which are mutable and can change in size and content. This immutability allows tuples to have a smaller memory footprint and faster access times.  

Real-world scenario where tuples are preferred over lists:
    
When you have a collection of sequence of items that should not change throughout the program,
such as A sequence consisting of a first name, last name, age, and address, tuples are a better choice.
Using a tuple to represent this information ensures that the data remains constant 

Example code:
    
#Defining a tuple to represent a person's information
person_info = ("Ashwini", "Ladkat", 30, "Hadpsar")
print("Person Information:", person_info)
Accessing elements of the tuple
print("First Name:", person_info[0])    
print("Last Name:", person_info[1])
print("Age:", person_info[2])
print("Address:", person_info[3])   

#Tuples is important for data integrity. If a list were used instead, there would be a risk of accidental modification of the person's information.  
if you tried to change an element of the tuple, it would raise an error:
 person_info[2] = 31   #This will raise a TypeError because tuples are immutable.
