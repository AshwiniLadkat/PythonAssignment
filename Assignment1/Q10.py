#Question- what will be the output of below code
print("10" + "10") 
print(10 + 10)
#Output will be     
    #1010
    #20
#Explanation :
    #In the first line, "10" and "10" are string datatye and hence the + operator concatenates them 
    #In the second line, 10 and 10 are integers and hence the + operator does teh addition operation
