# Explain why Python modules are considered the foundation of scalable software design?
# Python modules are considered the foundation of scalable software design for several reasons:
# 1. Modularity: Modules allow developers to break down complex software systems into smaller,  
# self-contained components. This modular approach makes it easier to manage and understand the codebase.
# 2. Reusability: Modules can be reused across different projects, reducing code duplication
# and promoting the use of well-tested and reliable code.
# 3. Maintainability: With modules, developers can update or fix specific parts of the
# software without affecting the entire system. This makes maintenance and updates more manageable.
# 4. Collaboration: In large software projects, multiple developers can work on different
# modules simultaneously, facilitating collaboration and speeding up the development process.
# 5. Namespace Management: Modules provide a separate namespace for their contents, 
# preventing naming conflicts and making it easier to organize code logically.
# Overall, Python modules enhance the scalability of software design by promoting
# modularity, reusability, maintainability, collaboration, and effective namespace management.
