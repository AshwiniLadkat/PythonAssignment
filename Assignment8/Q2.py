Why is indentaion mandatory in Python while it is optional in Languages like C, C++ or Java?
# Indentation is mandatory in Python because it defines the structure and flow of the code.
# In Python, blocks of code are defined by their indentation level, which makes the code 
# more readable and enforces a consistent coding style.
# In contrast, languages like C, C++, or Java use curly braces {} to define code blocks,
# making indentation optional. However, 
# using proper indentation in these languages is important for readability and maintainability.
