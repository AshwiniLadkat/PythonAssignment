#How does modular programming improve code reusability,testing and maintainability  in Python?
# Modular programming improves code reusability, testing, and maintainability in Python in several ways:
# 1. Code Reusability: By breaking down a program into smaller, self-contained modules, 
# developers can reuse these modules across different projects.
# This reduces code duplication and promotes the use of well-tested and reliable code.
# 2. Easier Testing: Modules can be tested independently, allowing developers to isolate    
# and identify issues more easily. Unit tests can be written for individual modules,
# ensuring that each component functions correctly before integrating it into the larger system.    
# 3. Improved Maintainability: Modular code is easier to maintain and update.
# Changes can be made to individual modules without affecting the entire codebase.
