#Predict the output
x= None
print(type(x))  Output will be <class 'NoneType'>
print(x==False)  Output will be False
Explain the result 
  Here x is assigned to None, which represents the absence of a value.\
  None type is not same as 0,False and Empty string 
  Hence the output of x==False evaluates to False
