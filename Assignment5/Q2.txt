#predict the output
ba = bytes([65, 66, 67])
print(ba)  # Output: b'ABC'
#Explain how numbers are converted internally   
Integer to Byte: The integer 65 is stored as a single byte of data in memory.
Encoding Lookup: The interpreter looks up the character associated with the value 65 in the ASCII table.
Mapping: The integer 65 maps to the character 'A', 66 maps to 'B', and 67 maps to 'C'.
and hence final result is b'ABC'
