#what is None in Python?Is it the same as 0 or false?,false,or empty string?

#None is the built in contant and represents the absense of a value or a null value .
#None is not the same as 0, false, or an empty string.
#None vs. 0:
            # 0 is an integer value, 
            # whereas None represent  as no value is present. 
            # 0 == None evaluates to False.
#None vs. False: False is a boolean value. 
                #While None is considered "falsy" in a boolean context
                # (i.e., it evaluates to False when used in a conditional statement),
                # it is not the same value as the boolean False [1].
                # False == None evaluates to False.
#None vs. Empty String (""):
            # An empty string is a sequence of characters with zero length. 
            # None is an object representing no value at all. 
            # "" == None evaluates to False.
