predict the output
s={10,20,30,10,20}
print(s)
 Output will be        
    {10, 20, 30}
Explanation :
    Sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements. 
    When we create a set with duplicate values, Python automatically removes the duplicates, 
    resulting in a set that contains only unique elements. In this case, 
     the duplicates 10 and 20 are removed,
