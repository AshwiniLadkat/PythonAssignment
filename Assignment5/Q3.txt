what is diffrence between byte and bytearray in python?
mention the mutability and usecases 
    Bytes and bytearray are both used to represent binary data in Python, but they 
    have some key differences:
    1. Mutability:
        Bytes are immutable, meaning once a bytes object is created, its content cannot be changed.
        if you try to modify a bytes object will raise a TypeError.   
        Bytearray, on the other hand, is mutable. You can modify the content of a
         bytearray object after its creation.
    2. Use Cases:
        Byte :  we can use bytes when we used Network protocols (sending):
                When data needs to be sent to another function or over a network connection without the 
               risk of accidental modification.
               while we can use bytes for Reading binary files where the data should remain unchanged.
        bytearray: we can use bytearray to Assembling data from fragments: 
                 Efficiently building up a large message from smaller chunks 
                 received over a socket connection, avoiding expensive concatenation 
                 operations that create new objects each time.
