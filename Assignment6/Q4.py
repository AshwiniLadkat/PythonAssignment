#difference between calling a function and defining a function with a simple explanation?

#ANS - 
    #Defining a function means creating the function by specifying its name, parameters, and the code that it will execute. This is done using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and a colon. For example:
    #def my_function(): 
        #function_body
    #Calling a function means executing the function that has already been defined. This is done by using the function name followed by parentheses. For example:
    #my_function()
