#Cab Python function exists without any statements inside its body?if Yes how?
#ANS:-
#Yes, a Python function can exist without any statements inside its body by using the `pass` statement. The `pass` statement is a placeholder that does nothing and allows the function to be syntactically correct. Here is an example:
def empty_function():
    pass
#In this example, `empty_function` is defined but does not perform any actions when called. The `pass` statement ensures that the function has a valid body, preventing any syntax errors.
