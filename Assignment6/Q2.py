#Explain the syntax of a function definition using  the def keyword .Why is the colon (:) manadotory at the end of the function header?
 #In Python, a function is defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses that may include parameters. The syntax for defining a function is as follows:
#def function_name(parameters):
    #function_body  
#Here, `function_name` is the name of the function, and `parameters` are optional inputs that the function can take. The function body contains the code that will be executed when the function is called.
#The colon (:) at the end of the function header is mandatory because it indicates the start    
#of the function body.
#indentation is used to define the scope of code blocks,
